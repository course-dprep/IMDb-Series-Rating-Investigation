# Research Motivation
Why did we choose this topic? (some random bullshit like the beginning of every paper)

# Research question:
- Does the length in seasons of a TV-show affect its overall rating?

# Dataset: IMDb

- It offers details like titles, release dates, cast info, ratings, and reviews, making it a popular resource for entertainment enthusiasts and professionals.
- Subsets of IMDb data can be accessed for personal/non-commercial purposes.
- This project will use IMDb to make a research about the interaction between the length of Tv-shows and their overall ratings.
